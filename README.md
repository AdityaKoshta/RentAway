Wanderlust is a full-stack travel booking app I built, inspired by Airbnb. The main idea was to let users browse and book accommodations, leave reviews, and manage their own listings. I focused on building a secure and smooth user experience from both the frontend and backend.

🔑 Features
User login and signup with JWT authentication and bcrypt for password hashing

Users can add, update, and delete property listings (with image uploads using Cloudinary)

Review and rating system for accommodations

Fully responsive UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap

Backend APIs built with Express and Node.js

MongoDB with Mongoose for storing and managing data
